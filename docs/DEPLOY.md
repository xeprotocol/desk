# Deploying the XE desk

One codebase, two deployments: staging at `desk.test.network` (both hosts set to it), production at `bounty.xe.network` + `support.xe.network`. Both read the testnet node until genesis. Everything below runs on the VPS under Docker Compose; nothing runs on a laptop.

## 0. Prerequisites on the VPS

- Ubuntu 22.04/24.04, 2 vCPU, 4 GB, 40 GB disk.
- Docker Engine 24+ with the compose plugin: `curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh`.
- DNS `A`/`AAAA` for both hosts pointing at the VPS.
- Caddy for TLS: `apt install caddy`, then `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile`:

  ```
  bounty.xe.network, support.xe.network {
      reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8010
      encode gzip
      header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000"
  }
  ```

  `systemctl reload caddy`. Caddy provisions both certificates and forwards the `Host` header, which is how the app knows which front door it is answering.

## 1. Get the code

```sh
sudo mkdir -p /opt/desk && sudo chown $USER /opt/desk
git clone <repo> /opt/desk
cd /opt/desk
cp .env.example .env
mkdir -p secrets
```

Edit `.env`:

- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: long random, ASCII letters and digits only (it is spliced into a URL and a `.env` line; `%`, `@`, `/`, `:`, `$`, `#` and non-ASCII all have meanings there). Postgres reads it once, when the `pgdata` volume is first created; changing it in `.env` afterwards changes what the app sends, not what Postgres expects. To change it later: `docker compose exec db psql -U desk -d desk -c "ALTER USER desk PASSWORD 'the-new-one'"`, then `docker compose up -d --force-recreate app worker`.
- `PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, `DESK_BOUNTY_HOST`, `DESK_SUPPORT_HOST`, `WEBAUTHN_RP_ID`: production values as in the example; for staging set both hosts to `desk.test.network` and the RP id to `test.network`.
- `DESK_SIGNER_PASSPHRASE`: long random (12+ chars); it encrypts the keyfile that holds the log key and the vault key.
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: a fine-grained token with Issues read/write and Pull requests read on `xeprotocol/xe`, `xeprotocol/dao`, `xeprotocol/sdk`, and Issues read on the private `xeprotocol/core`. `GITHUB_BOT_LOGIN`: the account it belongs to.
- `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: long random; the same string goes in the GitHub webhook.
- `INTERNAL_TRACKER_URL`: already `https://github.com/xeprotocol/core/issues/{ref}`; change only if the tracker moves (and change `internal.repo` in `config/desk.yaml` with it).
- `SMTP_*`: optional; without it, invite links are printed instead of emailed, and reporters' email sign-in links go to the app log (`docker compose logs app | grep "would send"`) rather than to them.
- `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`: for "Continue with GitHub" on the reporter sign-in. Create an OAuth App on the `xeprotocol` org (Settings → Developer settings → OAuth Apps): homepage `https://bounty.xe.network`, callback `https://bounty.xe.network/v1/reporter/auth/github/callback`. Both hosts send the browser to the bounty host for the callback; the cookie is set for `.xe.network` so it works on both. Left empty, the button is hidden and reporters sign in by email link or XE key.
- `DISCORD_*`: the support bot and Discord sign-in; §10. All empty: no bot, no button.
- `DESK_MAX_ATTACHMENT_MB`, `DESK_MAX_ATTACHMENTS`: filing-form limits (10 MB, 5 files by default). Attachments live in the `blobs` volume; private ones are sealed with the vault key, so the volume is useless without `secrets/signer.json`.

## 2. Build and test

```sh
cd /opt/desk
export GIT_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
docker compose build
```

Pure tests (no database, no network): wire-format checks, signed requests, the authorisation matrix, the status machine, the vault, TOTP against the RFC vector, config vocabularies, the triage parser against the real doc, templates and copy lint.

```sh
docker compose run --rm --no-deps -v $PWD/tests:/app/tests app \
  sh -c "pip install -q pytest pytest-asyncio && pytest -q tests/test_xe_wire.py tests/test_desk_core.py tests/test_triage.py tests/test_templates.py"
```

Database tests (a scratch database the tests wipe):

```sh
docker compose up -d --wait db            # --wait: returns once Postgres is healthy, not merely started
docker compose exec db psql -U desk -d desk -c "CREATE DATABASE desk_test"   # "already exists" is fine
docker compose run --rm --no-deps -v $PWD/tests:/app/tests \
  -e DESK_TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://desk:$(grep ^POSTGRES_PASSWORD .env | cut -d= -f2)@db:5432/desk_test \
  app sh -c "pip install -q pytest pytest-asyncio && pytest -q tests/test_db.py"
```

`test_triage_import_of_the_real_doc` imports the whole triage into the scratch database and checks the counts; if it fails, do not import into the real one.

Lint, if you want it: `docker compose run --rm --no-deps app sh -c "pip install -q ruff && ruff check desk tests"`.

## 3. Keys, migrate, first user

The services mount `secrets/` read-only, so the one write it ever gets is done with plain `docker run` against the built image, not through compose:

```sh
docker run --rm -v $PWD/secrets:/app/secrets --env-file .env desk-app desk keys init
ls -l secrets/signer.json                  # -rw------- root
```

Back up `secrets/signer.json` and the passphrase separately. Losing the vault key loses every private report; losing the log key means future entries are unsigned (the chain still verifies by hash).

```sh
docker compose up -d                       # db, migrate (one-shot), app, worker
docker compose logs migrate                # "Running upgrade -> 0001"
docker compose exec app desk users add cto@xe.network --name "CTO" --roles reviewer,tier,treasurer,admin
```

Open the printed invite link in a browser within seven days; it signs you in once. On `/team/account`, add a passkey, and set up a TOTP code as the fallback. Then `/team/users` to add the rest of the team (each gets an invite link), granting `tier` only to the CTO and named delegates.

## 4. Import

Order matters: GitHub first (so tickets exist with their threads and reporters), then the triage (which sets the facts and status on them), then the internal tracker (which confirms or adds internal refs and moves status from the tracker's state), then labels.

```sh
docker compose exec app desk import-github            # every repo in config/desk.yaml; minutes, rate-limit aware
docker compose exec app desk import-triage --dry-run  # prints the 90 rows as parsed; read it
docker compose exec app desk import-triage            # applies them; re-runnable
docker compose exec app desk import-internal          # reads xeprotocol/core; `xe#8` in a title links it to xe issue 8
docker compose exec app desk github-labels            # creates the desk's status labels on each repo
```

For the three email reports, put their bodies in a JSON file and pass `--emails /app/secrets/emails.json` (`{"E1": "...", "E2": "...", "E3": "..."}`); the bodies are sealed on write. Add payout addresses on the ticket pages when the reporters send them.

Then the worker's first `push` run (within a minute) puts the status labels on the issues and closes the ones the desk has closed. Check `/team/outbox`: it lists every ticket that was fixed but whose reporter has not been told. Work through it with the `patched` template.

## 5. Webhook

In each repo, Settings → Webhooks → Add: payload URL `https://bounty.xe.network/v1/github/webhook`, content type `application/json`, secret as in `.env`, events: Issues, Issue comments, Pull requests. On `xeprotocol/core` the same webhook with Issues only: when the CTO closes an internal ticket, the public ticket it names goes to `patched` and into the outbox within seconds. The poll every two minutes covers anything the webhook misses.

## 6. Agent tokens

```sh
docker compose exec app desk tokens issue cto@xe.network claude-fable-5.1 --label nightly --scopes read:public,write:notes,write:proposals,write:patch-refs --days 90
```

Or on `/team/tokens`. The token is shown once. An agent then reads `https://bounty.xe.network/llms.txt` and calls `/v1` with `Authorization: Bearer desk_…`.

## 7. Day to day

Schema changes ship as Alembic migrations; the `migrate` service runs them on every `up`. Routine update:

```sh
cd /opt/desk && git pull && docker compose build
docker compose up -d                       # migrate runs 0002…, then app and worker restart on the new image
docker compose --profile discord up -d     # if the bot is in use
```

`0002` adds what Releases 2 and 3 introduced (reporter sessions and links, payout proof, `tickets.channel_state`) with `IF NOT EXISTS`, so it is safe on a database of any age. If you ever need a clean slate instead: `docker compose run --rm migrate alembic downgrade base && docker compose run --rm migrate alembic upgrade head`, then re-create the first team user (`desk users add`, §3) and re-import (§4).

## 8. If a page is blank

Caddy answers an empty 502 when nothing is listening on 8010, and an empty 200 if it has no site block for the host; both look like a white page. In order:

```sh
docker compose ps                                   # app and worker "Up", migrate "Exited (0)"
docker compose logs --tail=50 app                   # the last lines say "Uvicorn running on 0.0.0.0:8000"
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' http://127.0.0.1:8010/v1/health   # 200 from the app itself
curl -sI -H 'Host: bounty.xe.network' http://127.0.0.1:8010/ | head -3    # 200 text/html
caddy validate --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile && systemctl status caddy --no-pager | head -5
curl -sI https://bounty.xe.network/ | head -3       # through Caddy
```

If `docker compose ps` shows no `app`, it was never started: `docker compose up -d`. If `app` is restarting, the log says why; the usual causes are a wrong `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` (the URL is built from it) or `migrate` having failed. If the app answers on 8010 but the domain does not, the problem is Caddy or DNS, not the desk.

## 9. Backups

`pgdata` (Postgres) and `blobs` (attachments) are compose volumes; `secrets/` is a bind mount. A nightly `pg_dump` plus a copy of `secrets/signer.json` is the whole backup. Without the keyfile, the dump's private bodies are unreadable, which is the point.

## 10. Discord

One Discord application does both the support bot and "Continue with Discord" on the sign-in page.

1. [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications) → New Application, named for the desk. On **General Information** copy the Application ID → `DISCORD_APP_ID`.
2. **OAuth2**: add redirect `https://bounty.xe.network/v1/reporter/auth/discord/callback` (the bounty host; the cookie is set for `.xe.network` so it works on both). Reset and copy the client secret → `DISCORD_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`.
3. **Bot**: Reset Token → `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`. Under Privileged Gateway Intents turn on **Message Content** (to read follow-ups in threads). Server Members is not needed. Public Bot off.
4. Invite it. OAuth2 → URL Generator: scopes `bot` and `applications.commands`; bot permissions View Channels, Send Messages, Send Messages in Threads, Create Private Threads, Manage Threads, Read Message History, Embed Links, Attach Files. Not Administrator. Open the URL, pick the server.
5. Ids, with Developer Mode on (User Settings → Advanced): right-click the server → Copy Server ID → `DISCORD_GUILD_ID`; the `#support` channel → `DISCORD_SUPPORT_CHANNEL_ID`; the role that answers support → `DISCORD_SUPPORT_ROLE_ID`. The bot's own role needs to be able to see and post in that channel.
6. `.env` filled in, then:

```sh
docker compose build
docker compose --profile discord up -d
docker compose logs -f bot        # "discord bot up as …"
```

7. In `#support`, as someone with the support role: `/panel`. The bot posts the topic menu. Pin it.

What happens then: a person picks a topic, a two-field form opens, and on submit the bot opens a private thread (public if the server cannot make private ones), adds them, mentions the support role, and creates `XS-nnnn` with `source=discord`. Everything written in the thread goes onto the ticket's public thread; the team answers either in the thread or on the desk, and the bot carries desk replies into the thread under the author's name. Closing from either side archives the thread with a one-line reason.

Slash commands, team role only unless noted: `/close [reason]` (`stale…` or `dup…` pick those reasons; anything else is answered), `/reopen`, `/bounty` (a question that is really a bug; the bot tells the reporter where it went and not to post a PoC), `/rename`, `/add @user`, `/answer` (the support templates from `config/copy/public.yaml`, posted under your name), `/ticket` (anyone: the desk link).

The bot keys reporters on their Discord id. When the same person later signs in on the web with Discord, the accounts are one and the thread shows under `/my`.

Restart after config changes: `docker compose --profile discord restart bot`. The bot is harmless when down: questions asked on the web still work, and desk replies to Discord tickets queue until it is back.
