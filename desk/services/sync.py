"""GitHub <-> desk.

Inbound: issues become tickets (idempotent on repo+number), comments become public-thread messages,
PRs that reference an issue become patch refs, and a PR that says it fixes the issue (`fixes #n`) moves
the ticket: `fixing` while open, `patched` once merged. Runs as a full import, a `since` poll, or per
webhook delivery; all three go through the same `upsert_*` functions.

Outbound: the status label on the issue (the tool's labels only; anything else on the issue is left
alone), queued replies as comments, and close/reopen when the desk closes or reopens. A private
ticket being disclosed opens a new issue. GitHub is the mirror; the desk is the record.
