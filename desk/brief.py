"""The agent brief: what a model holding a desk token is for, and how it works a ticket.

Served as markdown at `/v1/agent/brief.md` (JSON at `/v1/agent/brief`, a page at `/agent`), listed in
`/llms.txt` and the manifest. Built from the same config the desk runs on, so the vocabularies an agent must
send are the ones the desk accepts, and the config hash at the foot tells a runner when the brief changed.
Anything a token's owner wants their own agent to do differently goes in the token's standing instructions,
which `GET /v1/me` returns; this document is the part that is the same for everyone."""
